   Reading of FASTQ files (optionally gzip-compressed) in batches of
   records.

   The parsing follows the Biopython FastqGeneralIterator: the title line is
   kept as it is (except trailing whitespace); sequences and qualities can
   span several lines; the title on the "+" line is optional, but must be
   equal to the title of the record, if present.
