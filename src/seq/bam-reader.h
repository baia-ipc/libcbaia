/*
   Reading of BAM files, e.g. the unaligned BAM files written by Dorado
   and MinKNOW, in batches of FASTQ-like records (see fastq-reader.h).

   BAM is a series of BGZF blocks, which are gzip members: the file is
   decompressed with zlib, without htslib.

   For each record:
   - the title is the read name, followed by the tags (SAM text format,
     separated by tabs, as in the FASTQ output of Dorado), except array
     tags (type B, e.g. the move table) and the base modification tags
     (MM, ML, MN), whose positions refer to the whole read;
   - the sequence and qualities are in the orientation of the original
     read (reverse complemented, if the record is mapped to the minus
     strand); missing qualities are written as '!';
   - secondary and supplementary alignments are skipped.
