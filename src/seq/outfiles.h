/*
   Output files of a program writing the reads to several destinations,
   e.g. a demultiplexer (a destination for each sample), with one
   compressed file for each destination:
   - for an input file: <outdir>/<input basename>.<destination>.fastq.gz,
     where the suffix .fastq.gz, .fastq or .bam of the input file is
     removed;
   - for a group of input files (directory mode):
     <outdir>/<group>/<destination>.fastq.gz.

   The files are created when the first data are written to them; the data
   are written already compressed (gzip members).

   BAM output (see outfiles_set_bam): the files are <...>.bam instead of
   <...>.fastq.gz, the data are BGZF blocks, the header is written to each
   new file and the BGZF end-of-file marker when it is closed (it is removed
   before appending to an existing file).
