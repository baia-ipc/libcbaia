   Encoding of unaligned BAM data (header and records), to be compressed
   with BGZF (see bgzf-compressor.h).

   A record is given as a FASTQ-like entry, whose title contains the read
   name and SAM tags in text format, separated by tabs (as in the FASTQ
   output of Dorado, or of bam-reader.h): the record is unmapped (flag 4),
   the tags are encoded in binary form (integers with the smallest type,
   as in htslib); fields of the title which are not valid SAM tags are not
   written, nor the tags with the name of a tag already written (a record
   cannot have two tags with the same name: the first valid one is kept).
