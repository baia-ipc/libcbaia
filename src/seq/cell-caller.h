   Identification of the cell barcodes of a single-cell library: the

   in the reads are counted, and the barcodes of the cells are selected
   from the counts, given the expected number of cells N, as in Cell
   Ranger (version 2): the barcodes with a count of at least 1/10 of the
   99th percentile of the counts of the N most frequent barcodes.
