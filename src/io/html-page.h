/*
   Self-contained HTML reports: a page with a style for light and dark
   themes (no external resources), tiles with the main values, and plots as
   inline SVG (horizontal bar chart, histogram, barcode rank plot).

   A report is written as: html_page_start(), the content (headings,
   paragraphs, tables, tiles, plots), html_page_end(). The style defines:
   - text: h1, h2, h3; p.sub (subtitle), p.note (small, muted), p.running
     (highlighted box); tables (numbers right-aligned, td.seq: monospace);
   - div.tiles containing the tiles (html_tile());
   - SVG classes: s (main color, e.g. samples), p (secondary, muted color),
     a (accent line), line, grid, axis, muted, halo.
